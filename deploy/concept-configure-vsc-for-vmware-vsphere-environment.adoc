(VSC) supports numerous environments. Some of the features in these environments might require additional configuration.

You might have to perform some of the following tasks to configure your ESXi hosts, guest operating systems, and VSC:

* Verifying your ESXi host settings, including the UNMAP settings
* Adding timeout values for guest operating systems
* Regenerating the VSC SSL certificate
* Creating storage capability profiles and threshold alarms
* Modifying the preferences file to enable the mounting of datastores across different subnets
