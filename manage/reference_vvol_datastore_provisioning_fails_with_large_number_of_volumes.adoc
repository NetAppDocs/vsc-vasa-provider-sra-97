= VVol datastore provisioning fails with large number of volumes
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

== Issue

VVol datastore provisioning fails when you try to provision VVol datastores with more than six volumes.

== Cause

VVol datastore provisioning fails because of socket timeouts between VSC and VASA Provider.

== Corrective action

You should either create VVol datastore with less than six volumes or increase the VVol datastore size after provisioning using the Expand VVol Datastore option.
