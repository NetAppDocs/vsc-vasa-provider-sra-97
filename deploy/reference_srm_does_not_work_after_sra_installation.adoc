= NetApp Storage Replication Adapter for ONTAP does not appear on the Site Recovery Manager Appliance
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
== Issue

Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) does not appear on the Site Recovery Manager (SRM) Appliance interface after uploading and configuring SRA.

== Cause

There is no error displayed when wrong SRA credentials (username or password) are used to configure SRA using the following command.

`perl command.pl -I <sra-server-ip> <vp_username> <vp_passwd>`

== Corrective action

Update the configuration details of SRA using following command: `perl command.pl -U <sra-server-ip> <vp_username> <vp_passwd>`
