[.lead]
== Issue

VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) displays the status of the device as "`In progress`" for the newly SnapMirrored device.

== Cause

This issue occurs due to the presence of an entry with the same device name as the newly created device in the `/opt/netapp/vpserver/conf/devices.txt` file.

== Corrective action

You should manually delete the entries matching the device that you newly created from both the sites (site A and site B) from located at `/opt/netapp/vpserver/conf/devices.txt` and rerun discover devices. After the discovery completes, the devices will display the correct status.
