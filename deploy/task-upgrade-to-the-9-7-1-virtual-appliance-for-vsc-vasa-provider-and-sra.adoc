.About this task

The status of VASA Provider from the existing deployment is retained after the upgrade. You should manually enable or disable VASA Provider based on your requirement after you upgrade. However, it is best to enable VASA Provider even if VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols) are not in use, as it enables storage capability profiles for traditional datastore provisioning, and storage alarms.

[NOTE]
====
A direct upgrade from any release prior to 9.7 to 9.7P2 or later is not supported by the virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA. You should first upgrade your existing setup to the 9.7 release of the virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA before upgrading to any later release. When you upgrade to 9.7.1 release of virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA and you want to use vVols replication, then you will need to setup one more vCenter Server with virtual appliance with Site Recovery Manager (SRM) installed.
====

.Steps

. Mount the downloaded `.iso` file to the virtual appliance:
 .. Click menu:Edit Settings[DVD/CD-ROM Drive].
 .. Select *Datastore ISO* file from the drop-down list.
 .. Browse to and select the downloaded `.iso` file, and then select the *Connect at power on* checkbox.
. Access the *Summary* tab of your deployed virtual appliance.
. Click *image:../media/launch-maintenance-console.gif[]* to start the maintenance console.
. At the "`Main Menu`" prompt, enter option `2` for *System Configuration*, and then enter option `8` for *Upgrade*.
+
After the upgrade finishes, the virtual appliance restarts. The virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA is registered to the vCenter Server with the same IP address as before the upgrade.

. If you want the virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA to be registered with the vCenter Server with the IPv6 address, then you must perform the following:
 .. Unregister the virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA.
 .. Register the IPv6 address of the virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA to vCenter Server using the *Register* page.
 .. Regenerate VSC and VASA Provider certificates after the registration.

+
[NOTE]
====
IPv6 is supported only with vCenter Server 6.7 and later.
====
. Log out and re-login to the vSphere Client to view the deployed virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA.
 .. Log out from your existing vSphere web client or vSphere Client and close the window.
 .. Log in to the vSphere Client.
+
It might take a few minutes for the plug-in to be updated in the vSphere Client.
