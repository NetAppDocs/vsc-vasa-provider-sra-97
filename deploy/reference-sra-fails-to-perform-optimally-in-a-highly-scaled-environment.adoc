== Issue

SRA fails to perform optimally in a highly scaled environment (if running VMware specified maximum limits like 250 PGs, 250 RPs, 5000 VMs), and you might notice issues such as a timeout error or a ONTAP timeout.

== Corrective action

You must modify the timeout intervals.

[NOTE]
====
You can also modify the memory settings for scale and performance of your virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA in highly scaled setups.
