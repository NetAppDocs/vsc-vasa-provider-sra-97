[.lead]
The status of VASA Provider for ONTAP might appear as "`Offline`" in the vCenter Server GUI after you restart the VASA Provider service.

== Workaround

. Check the status of VASA Provider from the virtual appliance for Virtual Storage Console (VSC), VASA Provider, and Storage Replication Adapter (SRA), and ensure that VASA Provider is active.
. In the VSC page of vCenter Server, verify that VASA Provider is enabled by navigating to menu:Configuration[Manage Extensions].
. On the vCenter Server, check the `/var/log/vmware/vmware-sps/sps.log` file for any connection errors with VASA Provider.
. If there are any errors, restart the "`vmware-sps`" service.
