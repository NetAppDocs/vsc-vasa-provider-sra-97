= File creation error while provisioning virtual machines on VVol datastores
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

== Issue

Cannot create virtual machine using the default storage virtual machine (SVM) or any mixed storage virtual machine (SVM) that has both IPv6 and IPv4 data LIFS configured.

== Cause

The issue occurs because the default vs0 has both IPv6 and IPv4 data LIFs, and is not a purely IPv4 datastore.

== Corrective action

You can provision a virtual machine with vs0 using the following steps:

. Use System Manager application to disable all the IPv6 LIFs .
. Rediscover the cluster.
. Provision a virtual machine on the VVol datastore on which the provisioning was failing.
+
The virtual machine is successfully provisioned.
