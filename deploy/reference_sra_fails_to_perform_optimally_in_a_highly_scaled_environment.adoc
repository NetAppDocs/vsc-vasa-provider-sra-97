= SRA fails to perform optimally in a highly scaled environment
:icons: font

== Issue

SRA fails to perform optimally in a highly scaled environment (if running VMware specified maximum limits like 250 PGs, 250 RPs, 5000 VMs), and you might notice issues such as a timeout error or a ONTAP timeout.

== Corrective action

You must modify the timeout intervals.

====
You can also modify the memory settings for scale and performance of your virtual appliance for VSC, VASA Provider, and SRA in highly scaled setups.https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/Virtual_Storage_Console_for_VMware_vSphere/tune_memory_settings_of_VM_VSC%2C_VASA_Provider%2C_and_SRA_for_scale_and_performance
