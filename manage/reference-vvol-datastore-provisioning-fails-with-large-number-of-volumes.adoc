== Issue

VVol datastore provisioning fails when you try to provision VVol datastores with more than six volumes.

== Cause

VVol datastore provisioning fails because of socket timeouts between VSC and VASA Provider.

== Corrective action

You should either create VVol datastore with less than six volumes or increase the VVol datastore size after provisioning using the *Expand VVol Datastore* option.
